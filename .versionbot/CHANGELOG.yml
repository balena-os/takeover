    - subject: Take into account that chars are signed also in 32-bit x86
      hash: bec1460e58fc62b988980d47b3f52be9c895018a
      body: |
        Previously, our code had different paths to deal with the fact that in
        the C world, chars are signed in x86_64. However, chars are signed also
        in x86 (i.e., the 32-bit platform), and this case we were not handling.

        This commit simply makes sure we handle both x86 and x86_64 in the same
        way: by using the `i8` type for chars.

        Fields of the `sysinfo` structure are `u32` or `u64` depending on the
        architecture. This makes sure both types are accepted.
