    - subject: Add option to change device type
      hash: 2bfb52c339ad9a48bfed9c64c734516d5db435af
      body: >
        - add a command line option `change_dt_to` which accepts a device type
        slug

        - if this option is passed, we change the device type value being used
        in the parsed `config.json`
          this allows further migration workflows to use the correct target device type
        - we also PATCH the device type in the API so further hostOS updates are
        consistent with the new device type

    - subject: "Handle race: when reading /proc/PID/status"
      hash: 5386618f02927bf952ffea2fc5ab0a1b7aa3d7d8
      body: |
        Iterating over /proc and doing some operation over its entries is
        inherently racy, because entries on the /proc filesystem can vanish at
        any time as processes die.

        In order to take this into account, this commit changes the error
        handling of a `read_to_string()` call we make while iterating over
        `/proc` to print a list of processes.

        We now simply ignore "file not found" errors, which is fine because the
        status information about a process that has already exited will not be
        used in any meaningful way.

        Other errors may represent something serious, so they are reported and
        cause the migration to be aborted.

      body: |
        Short story: the value read from `/proc/PID/root` wasn't being used
        anywhere, so this commit just got rid of this reading, and of the value
        itself.

        Longer story: the initial motivation for this change was a race
        condition when doing this reading. Iterating over /proc and doing some
        operation over its entries is inherently racy, because entries on the
        /proc filesystem can vanish at any time as processes die. Therefore, the
        reading would sometimes fail with "file not found", which would
        needlessly and unfortunately abort the migration process.

        Iterating over /proc and doing some operation over its entries is

        In order to take this into account, this commit changes the error
        handling of a `read_link()` call we make while iterating over the
        processes. If the error is a "file not found", we now simply ignore it.
        This is safe to do, because we are only skipping code that would try to
        kill the process (which doesn't exist anymore anyway).

        Other errors may represent something serious, so they are reported and
        cause the migration to be aborted.

      body: |
        Iterating over /proc and doing some operation over its entries is
        inherently racy, because entries on the /proc filesystem can vanish at
        any time as processes die.

        We previously had some code to ignore `lstat()` errors that could happen
        for this reason. However, that code was ignoring *any* `lstat()` error,
        not just "file not found".

        This commit makes sure we ignore only "file not found" errors when
        calling `lstat()`. Other errors may represent something serious, so they
        are reported and cause the migration to be aborted.

      hash: cd6cc5e843e7eeed30d6a41ba0998325ab82d317
      body: |
        We have recently added code to migrate system connection and proxy
        configs during balenaOS-to-balenaOS migrations. That code was working
        correctly, but it wasn't following the same patterns as similar
        previously existing code followed.

        This commit refactors the new code to follow the established patterns,
        which shall make takeover maintenance easier.

        Being more specific, the idea is to make the new code more aligned with
        the code we already had for handling WiFi networks:

        1. In `migrate_info.rs` populate the `MigrateInfo` fields. This is what
           we were already doing for `wifis`.
        2. In `stage1.rs` do the actual copying. Again, this is similar to what
           we did for `wifis``: this is the same place we currently already
           create the connection files for WiFi.

        In summary, this is just trying to keep similar operations closer
        together in the code, which hopefully will help future maintainers to
        understand it.

      hash: 072addb7f2abdd451296a5fd24d51360bb22fb1f
      body: >
        We were relying on the fact that our current targets link the C runtime

        statically. However, this may be different for other targets and could

        even change in the future (e.g., see

        https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/422).


        With this commit we adopt the current recommendation, which is enabling

        the crt-static target feature when building. See

        https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html#static-and-dynamic-c-runtimes

        for details.


        Given the current defaults for Rust targets, this change should be a

        no-op, but this shall make us safer and more resilient to Rust changes

        in the long run.

      hash: 643428f725a6e7e8a102507c5f19827733857fb9
      body: |
        At the end of stage1, we bind-mount `takeover` on top of `init`, and
        then call `telinit u`. Unfortunately, in some distributions (like
        Devuan) `telinit` is a symlink to `init`. In this case, we lose access
        to `telinit`, because the symlink now points to what is effectively
        `takeover`.

        With this commit, we check if `telinit` is a symlink to `init`, and if
        so, we make a safe copy of `telinit` so that we can call it after the
        bind-mounting takes place.

      hash: 513810c7b31cd865eed908b096ae79b43717ce2c
      body: |
        This is for better troubleshooting.

        In one of my test runs, takeover failed because it was unable to kill
        one of the processes during stage2. The logs contained only the PID of
        the process, which was not enough to form any hypothesis about what
        could have failed.

        We already had code that would log a nice process table including the
        program names, but strangely this was executed only when and if all
        processes were killed successfully.

        This commit:

        1. Factor out the process table logging into a separate function.
        2. Call this function before trying to kill the processes.

        This adds the `--no-dt-check` option, which skips the checks for
        compatibility between the actual device and the device type of the
        target fleet. It will also skip a similar check by device type when
        downloading the balenaOS image.

        This is useful for running takeover on devices that are technically
        compatible with the fleet device type, but are not officially
        tested/supported.

        - /v6/release returns a different response `JSON` compared to
        /device-types/v1/

        and does not contain the `latest` field.

        - replaced struct `Versions` with a type alias to `Vec<String>`

        - modified `determine_versions` to handle new data structure and
        [unified
        images](https://blog.balena.io/unified-balenaos-releases-now-available/)

        - added unit tests for `determine_versions`

        - modified README to remove reference to `dev` and `prod` images

      body: |
        The only required adjustment in the code itself was in src/init.rs. In
        the older version of `nix`, `Result<T>` was defined as `Result<T,
        Error>`, and `Error` had to be converted to an `Errno` with the `
        as_errno()` method.

        In the newer version, `Result<T>` is defined as `Result<T, Errno>`. We
        get the `Errno` directly, so we don't need to call `as_errno()` anymore.

    - subject: Take into account that chars are signed also in 32-bit x86
      hash: bec1460e58fc62b988980d47b3f52be9c895018a
      body: |
        Previously, our code had different paths to deal with the fact that in
        the C world, chars are signed in x86_64. However, chars are signed also
        in x86 (i.e., the 32-bit platform), and this case we were not handling.

        This commit simply makes sure we handle both x86 and x86_64 in the same
        way: by using the `i8` type for chars.

        Fields of the `sysinfo` structure are `u32` or `u64` depending on the
        architecture. This makes sure both types are accepted.
