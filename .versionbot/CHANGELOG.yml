    - subject: Enable the crt-static target feature
      hash: 072addb7f2abdd451296a5fd24d51360bb22fb1f
      body: >
        We were relying on the fact that our current targets link the C runtime

        statically. However, this may be different for other targets and could

        even change in the future (e.g., see

        https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/422).


        With this commit we adopt the current recommendation, which is enabling

        the crt-static target feature when building. See

        https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html#static-and-dynamic-c-runtimes

        for details.


        Given the current defaults for Rust targets, this change should be a

        no-op, but this shall make us safer and more resilient to Rust changes

        in the long run.

    - subject: Make copy of `telinit` if a symlink to `init`
      hash: 643428f725a6e7e8a102507c5f19827733857fb9
      body: |
        At the end of stage1, we bind-mount `takeover` on top of `init`, and
        then call `telinit u`. Unfortunately, in some distributions (like
        Devuan) `telinit` is a symlink to `init`. In this case, we lose access
        to `telinit`, because the symlink now points to what is effectively
        `takeover`.

        With this commit, we check if `telinit` is a symlink to `init`, and if
        so, we make a safe copy of `telinit` so that we can call it after the
        bind-mounting takes place.

      body: |
        The latest version of clap requires a newer version of the Rust
        toolchain. So, in this commit we:

        1. Update the toolchain to the latest stable version.
        2. Fix the new clippy warnings that appeared after the update.

    - subject: Log process list before killing processes
      hash: 513810c7b31cd865eed908b096ae79b43717ce2c
      body: |
        This is for better troubleshooting.

        In one of my test runs, takeover failed because it was unable to kill
        one of the processes during stage2. The logs contained only the PID of
        the process, which was not enough to form any hypothesis about what
        could have failed.

        We already had code that would log a nice process table including the
        program names, but strangely this was executed only when and if all
        processes were killed successfully.

        This commit:

        1. Factor out the process table logging into a separate function.
        2. Call this function before trying to kill the processes.

    - subject: Allow running with unsupported target device types
      hash: 91e731c3c2e333d781d50c715469da8fde683b2b
      body: |
        This adds the `--no-dt-check` option, which skips the checks for
        compatibility between the actual device and the device type of the
        target fleet. It will also skip a similar check by device type when
        downloading the balenaOS image.

        This is useful for running takeover on devices that are technically
        compatible with the fleet device type, but are not officially
        tested/supported.

      hash: d9e0efce241ca3886412d107ec9b7bc40e7ba092
      body: >
        - /device-types/v1/ has been deprecated per issue #18

        - currently using percent-encoded url and replacing device-type in the
        url

        - /v6/release returns a different response `JSON` compared to
        /device-types/v1/

        and does not contain the `latest` field.

        - replaced struct `Versions` with a type alias to `Vec<String>`

        - modified `determine_versions` to handle new data structure and
        [unified
        images](https://blog.balena.io/unified-balenaos-releases-now-available/)

        - added unit tests for `determine_versions`

        - modified README to remove reference to `dev` and `prod` images

      body: |
        The only required adjustment in the code itself was in src/init.rs. In
        the older version of `nix`, `Result<T>` was defined as `Result<T,
        Error>`, and `Error` had to be converted to an `Errno` with the `
        as_errno()` method.

        In the newer version, `Result<T>` is defined as `Result<T, Errno>`. We
        get the `Errno` directly, so we don't need to call `as_errno()` anymore.

    - subject: Take into account that chars are signed also in 32-bit x86
      hash: bec1460e58fc62b988980d47b3f52be9c895018a
      body: |
        Previously, our code had different paths to deal with the fact that in
        the C world, chars are signed in x86_64. However, chars are signed also
        in x86 (i.e., the 32-bit platform), and this case we were not handling.

        This commit simply makes sure we handle both x86 and x86_64 in the same
        way: by using the `i8` type for chars.
